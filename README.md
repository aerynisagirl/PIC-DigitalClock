# PIC-DigitalClock-Test
A simple digital clock project I made using a PIC microcontroller

A small and simple digital clock I made using a PIC microcontroller, 4 transistors, 4 seven-segment displays, a couple of LED's used for the colon, and 2 buttons used for user interface to set the time of the clock. As of right now it's not complete as the time keeping system is not ready at all. It doesn't even work.
